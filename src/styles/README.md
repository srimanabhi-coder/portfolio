# CSS Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This project uses a **component-based CSS architecture** following industry best practices for maintainability, scalability, and developer experience.

## File Descriptions

### globals.css
- **Purpose**: Contains global styles, CSS resets, and common utilities
- **Includes**:
  - Global resets and box-sizing
  - Common typography settings
  - Shared component styles (buttons, tech tags, section titles)
  - Animation keyframes
  - Scrollbar styling

### utils/responsive.css
- **Purpose**: Centralized responsive design utilities
- **Includes**:
  - Media queries for different screen sizes
  - Responsive layout adjustments
  - Mobile-first responsive design patterns

### Component CSS Files
Each component has its own CSS file containing:
- Component-specific styles
- Hover effects and transitions
- Component layout and positioning
- Color schemes and typography specific to that component

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Easy to find and modify styles for specific components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced risk of unintended side effects

### 2. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new components without affecting existing ones
- Consistent structure for team collaboration
- Modular approach allows for easy refactoring

### 3. **Performance**
- Smaller CSS files load faster
- Better browser caching
- Reduced CSS bundle size in production

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Clear file organization
- Easy debugging and development
- Better IDE support and autocomplete

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Components
1. Create a new CSS file in `src/styles/components/`
2. Name it after your component (e.g., `NewComponent.css`)
3. Import it in your React component: `import '../styles/components/NewComponent.css'`

### Common Patterns
- Use the `.fade-in-up` class for entrance animations
- Use common utility classes from `globals.css`
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Keep component-specific styles in their respective files

### Best Practices
- Use semantic class names
- Follow BEM methodology when appropriate
- Keep styles scoped to their components
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Leverage the common utilities from globals.css

## Migration Notes
This architecture replaces the previous monolithic `App.css` approach, providing better organization and maintainability for the growing codebase.
